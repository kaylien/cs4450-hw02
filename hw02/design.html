User-First Design <br> <br>

- As a normal user, I can make posts that my followers can see <br>
	* To make a post, I would go to the home page of the website and click a button that says, "Tweet" or "Make new post". It will lead me to another web page that allows me to type into a text box what I want to publish. I will then click the "Post" button on the page that will put the post online, appearing in all of the feeds of my followers and on my profile when viewed. <br>
- As a normal user, I can follow other accounts <br>
	* To follow other accounts, I go to the home page and click the search bar, then type in the username or name of the person I would like to follow. Then a list of user profile descriptions (showing name and username) is displayed that contain the entered criteria in the search bar. If I click a profile description, I will go to that user profile. I can click the follow button to follow that new user. Now when I am looking at my feed of posts of other users, I can see the new user's posts that I just followed. <br>
- As a normal user, I can read posts of people I follow <br>
	* I would go to the home page of the website. This will automatically have a feed of the latest 15 posts of the users that I follow in chronological order. I can click a button that chooses to load more posts following the initial home page's posts. <br>
- As a normal user, I can delete my account <br>
	* To delete my account, I would click the link to my profile page on the home page of the website. Then I would click the settings button (that is only visible on my own profile page to myself, I cannot see anyone else's setting buttons nor can they see mine). There is a button that says "Delete account" on the page and once I click it, it will delete my account, erasing my profile page, all of my posts and "likes" on other posts, and no other users will follow me/I will not be following any other users.
- As a normal user, I can "like" other posts <br>
	* To like posts, I would see them in one of two ways. Either the post is appearing on my feed in the home page, or I made a search for a user profile in the search bar on the home page and clicked on a profile that displayed all of that user's posts. Either way, once I see the post, there will be a small heart in the corner of each post and when I click it, it will add a like to that post. The post will display a count of how many likes it has received. Each post can only be liked by an individual user once.

- Users<br>
	* Email address<br>
	* Username<br>
	* Posts<br>
	* Followers<br>
	* Following<br><br>
- Posts<br>
	* Reference to user<br>
	* Text content of the post<br>
	* Date<br>
	* Like count<br>

RESTful Routes:<br>
Users can "create" more posts by clicking the make a post button on the home page, then being directed to a new page and clicking post after entering their text content<br>
You can "retrieve" the posts you create by going onto your own profile or seeing it appear in the feed on the home page<br>
You can "update" your post by clicking edit on it<br>
You can "delete" your post by clicking delete on it<br>
The index of the posts is seen on the home page as a feed of the users that you follow including your own posts <br>
You can fill out the form for new posts and click post<br>

Constraints: You can't delete or edit posts that aren't your own. You can't see all posts of all users indexed on the home page, only the ones you follow. <br>

	* Reference to user<br>
	* Users being followed<br><br>

You can "retrieve" the users you follow by clicking the number of "following" on your profile page<br>
You can "update" the users you follow by clicking follow on the profile of the user you are following, and it will lead you to a page asking if you want to follow this person, if you click "yes" it will update<br>
